The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [July 28, Sunday, 2019].

## Log of Round 1 of #100DaysOfCode

### Day 1: July 28. Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I did some problem solving challanges in hackerrank.com.

**Thoughts:** It's been a long time not directly handed to such competitive programming question. Actually it takes time to get back and remember everything.

### Day 4: July 31. Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 
Today I want make a tool defined here. 
https://github.com/glassnode/code-challenges/blob/master/software-engineer-challenge.md
Techs I will use : 
- golang (since I want to learn it)
- go-kit (microservices tool for go)
- docker (container)

**Thoughts:** To make me able to build apps using above techs, I need to read the documentation and example as well. So in this first day of this project, I don't have much time to code the feature, but I took a lot of time to read the documentation, constructed the repository structure, installed the tool, etc. Hopefully I can finish this project very well.
